# Container Escape Shell
Minimal bash script that allows to run commands in the host system with root privileges by exploiting cgroup `notify_on_release`.

This script is an enhancement based on the original PoC from the blog post [Understanding Docker container escapes](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/) by Dominik 'disconnect3d' Czarnota.

For testing and researching purposes only.
